# Hide-and-Seek
Attempt for cross platform game. Pairs devices with wifi-direct and start a 2D hide and seek game.  
This game was abandoned in the process despite of the android devices being correctly paired.  
As soon as I paired the devices i lost interest in the game concept and I started working on another project.

**IDE:** Android Studio<br>
**FRAMEWORK:** LibGDX
<br>

## GAMEPLAY
The game concept is that 2 users pair their devices through wifi-direct and then start a game of hide and seek in a dark apartment with 3x3 room apartment. The seeker has to find the hiders and then rush to the starting point and disqualify them. The hiders have to hide and find the starting point of the seeker and get to it. The hiders must do so in limited time.

## LIMITATIONS
The users can still pair their phones via wifi-direct from within the game and the host can start the game. There is not much to see
beyond that except for some movement and and synchronization between the players. I hope someday I will complete this project.
